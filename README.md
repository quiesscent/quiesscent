# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hey, Iâ€™m Ephesians Lewis â€” a software engineer who loves building APIs, full-stack apps, and smart systems with Python, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like Django, Express, Flask, and Next.js. Iâ€™ve worked on projects like e-commerce platforms (with M-Pesa, Paystack, and Flutterwave integration), healthcare systems (modular Django apps with OAuth 2.0, medical records, appointments, and real-time chat with Django Channels), and finance tracking tools. I use PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and Prisma ORM, and Iâ€™m diving deeper into AI agents, automation, and React Native. Iâ€™ve freelanced on management systems, handled backend dev at Computer Engineering Forum. Youâ€™ll find me hacking on something new, learning daily, and always ready to collaborate on cool ideas.<br><be>
